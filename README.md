# NeutriumJS.utilities

## Introduction

NeutriumJS.utilities is a collection of general purpose utility objects for use throughout the NeutriumJS library.

## Getting Started

### Adding NeutriumJS

#### Bower.io

You can install NeutriumJS.utilities using bower.

	bower install neutriumjs-utilities

### Standalone

If your project is not using bower you can use the compiled and minified source which is found at:

	dist/NeutriumJS.utilities.min.js

## Including the library

The NeutriumJS.Utilities module can be included into your page using the following:

	<script charset="utf-8" src="NeutriumJS.utilities.min.js"></script>

As this module grows you may decide that you only want to include specific objects for the sake of site speed. This can be done by selectively including the source files found in /src. Please note however that the files in /src should be concatanated and minified with the rest of you javascript source.
